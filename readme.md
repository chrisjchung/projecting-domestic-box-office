# Projecting Domestic Box Office Revenues
Chris Chung

This project aimed to project domestic box office revenues for upcoming movies using known characteristics of the movies such as budget, prior success of the director, etc. The project required scraping data from IMDb and The Numbers, cleaning the data, and building a linear regression model using feature engineering, polynomial features, and regularization.
